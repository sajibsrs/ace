# Language

- Added the `_` discard to destructuring declarations and assignments: a bare
  `_` drops its value, binds nothing, may repeat, and is never read; `_ = f()`
  drops one result. `_` can no longer name a declaration, so `_: T` binders in
  `std/utf8`, `pkg/http`, and tests became bare `_`.
